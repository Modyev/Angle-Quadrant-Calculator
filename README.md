# Angle Quadrant Calculator

This is a simple program that calculates the quadrant of a given angle in a 2D plane.

### **How it Works:**

- The program takes an input angle and determines in which of the four quadrants the angle lies:
  - **1st Quadrant:** 0° < angle < 90°
  - **2nd Quadrant:** 90° < angle < 180°
  - **3rd Quadrant:** 180° < angle < 270°
  - **4th Quadrant:** 270° < angle < 360°

### **How to use:**

1. Input an angle (positive or negative)
2. The program will return the corresponding quadrant for the angle

### **Example:**

- Input: `330`  
  - Output: `[4th Quadrant] The angle '330' is in the 4th Quadrant ("330")`
- Input: `-200`
  - Output: `[2nd Quadrant] The angle '-200' is in the 2nd Quadrant ("160")`
- Input: `-1080`
  - Output: `[1st Quadrant] The angle '-1080' is in the 1st Quadrant ("0")`
